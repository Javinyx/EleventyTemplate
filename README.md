This is a small educational project which helped me get the hang of Eleventy and Sass.
It uses Netlify to deploy and uses the Netlify CMS as a GUI backend.

I made this into a template for anyone who needs a similar configuration, although consider this in no way finished as it contains various examples I found from tutorials online which should be removed.
